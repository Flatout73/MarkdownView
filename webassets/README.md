# Dev Setup

To build you need [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/). On macOS you can install them with `brew install yarn` and `brew install node` if you have the [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager installed.

# Build instructions

Run these two commands:

    yarn install
    npm run build

This will create the `dist` folder. That folder should also be checked in into the repository.
